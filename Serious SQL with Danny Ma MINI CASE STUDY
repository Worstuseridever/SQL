This mini case study is a debugging procedure of one company’s poor SQL queries into proper SQL queries. 
Each question will have the “bad” code listed first and the corrected code listed second.
I was able to score 100% on the quiz using my corrected codes to answer the questions

—1. How many unique users exist in the logs dataset?

--incorrect code
SELECT
  COUNT DISTINCT user_id
FROM health.user_logs;
--correct code
SELECT
  COUNT (DISTINCT health.user_logs.id) AS unique_ids
FROM health.user_logs;

– for questions 2-8 we created a temporary table

--incorrect code
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_measure_count;
CREATE TEMP TABLE user_measure_cout
SELECT
    id,
    COUNT(*) AS measure_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT measure) as unique_measures
  FROM health.user_logs
  GROUP BY 1; 
--correct code
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_measure_count;
CREATE TEMP TABLE user_measure_count AS (
SELECT
    id,
    COUNT(*) AS measure_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT measure) as unique_measures
  FROM health.user_logs
  GROUP BY 1
  ); 
  
  
– 2. How many total measurements do we have per user on average?

--incorrect code
SELECT
  ROUND(MEAN(measure_count))
FROM user_measure_count;
-- correct code
SELECT
  ROUND(AVG(measure_count),2) AS average_measures_per_person
FROM user_measure_count;


– 3. What about the median number of measurements per user?

--incorrect code
SELECT
  PERCENTILE_CONTINUOUS(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY id) AS median_value
FROM user_measure_count;
--correct code
SELECT 
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY measure_count) AS median_value
FROM user_measure_count;



– 4. How many users have 3 or more measurements?

--incorrect code
SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM user_measure_count
HAVING measure >= 3;
--correct code
SELECT
  COUNT(*) users_with_3_measures
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE measure_count >= 3;



– 5. How many users have 1,000 or more measurements?

--incorrect code
SELECT
  SUM(id)
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE measure_count >= 1000;
--correct code
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS users_with_1000_measures
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE measure_count >= 1000;



– 6. Have logged blood glucose measurements?

--incorrect code
SELECT
  COUNT DISTINCT id
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE measure is 'blood_sugar';
--correct code
SELECT
  COUNT (DISTINCT id)
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE measure = 'blood_glucose'



– 7. Have at least 2 types of measurements?

--incorrect code
SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE COUNT(DISTINCT measures) >= 2;
--correct code
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS using_2_metrics
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE unique_measures >= 2;



– 8. Have all 3 measures - blood glucose, weight and blood pressure?

--incorrect code
SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM usr_measure_count
WHERE unique_measures = 3;
--correct code
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS using_all_metrics
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE unique_measures = 3;



– 9. What is the median systolic/diastolic blood pressure values?

--incorrect code
SELECT
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN (ORDER BY systolic) AS median_systolic
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN (ORDER BY diastolic) AS median_diastolic
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE measure is blood_pressure;
--correct code
SELECT
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY systolic) AS median_systolic,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY diastolic) AS median_diastolic
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE measure = 'blood_pressure';
